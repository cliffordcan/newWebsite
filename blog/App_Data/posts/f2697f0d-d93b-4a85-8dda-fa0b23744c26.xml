I decided to get back into IT, but in the intervening years, I had made myself un-hirable in that industry. I began to look at school options to facilitate this career change though most were lengthy and impractical for my needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;It was around this time I began to hear about programming “boot camps” springing up all around the country. The need for software developers is greater than it has ever been. These shorter duration educational options are perfect for getting a solid understanding of the industry in a reasonable amount of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;I started doing research on the boot camp options in my area. I contacted tech recruiters to determine which skills are the most useful for this part of the country. It was all of this research that led me to The Tech Academy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;At The Tech Academy the focus is on a much broader range of exposure than other similar schools. I had the opportunity to refresh my knowledge in some areas through the Computer Basics course. I got a more in depth knowledge of SQL through the SQL course. And I got so much hands on experience in all aspects of development that I was certain that I had made the right choice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"&gt;I have just accepted my first job as a software developer. This is the most excited I have been about working in quite some time. As I get more adept in this field I will have many more opportunities in my future. I look forward to all of the potential this field holds for us who dared to accept the challenge. This is the best decision I have ever made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>
